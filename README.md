## to Henry: 
for the machine learning, there are multiple attempts at projecting wins and losses using linear and logistic regression in the folder. Obviously a lot of trial and error and data manipulation to try and get a functional model- but happy with where we're at and should be able to refine the model and get better results fairly easily moving forward. 

Currently we attempt to project wins and losses based on individual quarterback play and defensive performance using one stat (EPA), we will continue to explore other relevant statistics (completion percentage over expected, point differential, vegas win probability, etc.) this wk but felt this was a baseline to build upon at this time.
